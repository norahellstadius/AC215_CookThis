Actions Required for Milestone 4:

1. Train the model using the complete dataset.
- Possible to do on runpod? 
- Otherwise figure how GCP buckets? 
2. Optimize the model through hyperparameter tuning.
3. Reduce model size through compression techniques.
4. Deploy the model by hosting it on Vertex AI.
5. Ensure the capability for inference.
